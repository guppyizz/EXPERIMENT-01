## Experiment 01 – Hello World & Basic Calculator in C++

This program serves as an introductory C++ application demonstrating:

- Displaying a basic `"Hello World"` message.
- Implementing a simple calculator using conditional statements.
- Performing arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Using basic input/output with `cin` and `cout`.
- Handling division by zero with a preventive check.

**Program Workflow:**  
The calculator accepts two numeric inputs and an arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). It then performs the corresponding operation and displays the result.
