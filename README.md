## Experiment 01 – Hello World & Basic Calculator in C++

This program is a simple introductory C++ application that demonstrates:
- Displaying a basic "Hello World" message.
- Implementing a basic calculator using conditional statements.
- Handling arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Basic user input and output using `cin` and `cout`.

The calculator takes two numbers and an arithmetic operator as input and returns the result accordingly. It also includes a basic check to prevent division by zero.

## Experiment 02 – C++ Data Types and Bit Sizes

This program demonstrates the use of different fundamental data types in C++:
- `int` for age
- `float` for GPA
- `char` for grade
- `bool` for pass/fail status

It also uses the `sizeof()` operator to determine the size (in bits) of each data type by multiplying the byte-size by 8. The output clearly displays the value stored and how much memory each type uses.

### Key Concepts:
- Introduction to data types in C++
- Usage of `sizeof()` to find memory size
- Boolean interpretation (1 = true, 0 = false)

## Experiment 03 – Arithmetic, Relational & Logical Operations in C++

This C++ program demonstrates the use of:
- Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Relational operations: checking if one number is greater than the other
- Logical operations: AND (`&&`), OR (`||`)

It prompts the user to input two numbers and then shows:
- Results of basic math operations
- Boolean evaluations of logical expressions

### Key Concepts:
- Use of arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Relational operator: `>`
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`
- Boolean outputs: `1 = true`, `0 = false`

This experiment helps understand how expressions are evaluated and how conditional logic works in C++.
