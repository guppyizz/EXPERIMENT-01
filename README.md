## Experiment 01 – Hello World & Basic Calculator in C++

This program is a simple introductory C++ application that demonstrates:
- Displaying a basic "Hello World" message.
- Implementing a basic calculator using conditional statements.
- Handling arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Basic user input and output using `cin` and `cout`.

The calculator takes two numbers and an arithmetic operator as input and returns the result accordingly. It also includes a basic check to prevent division by zero.
